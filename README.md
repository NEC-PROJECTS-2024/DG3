## Introduction
The importance of prioritizing healthcare for a healthy lifestyle is evident, yet accessing medical consultation can be challenging at times. To address this, a proposed solution involves developing a healthcare chatbot utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), a component of Artificial Intelligence. This chatbot aims to diagnose diseases and provide essential medical guidance, thereby reducing healthcare expenses and improving accessibility to medical information. Some chatbots serve as medical reference guides, empowering patients with insights into their conditions and aiding in health improvement. The effectiveness of such a chatbot lies in its comprehensive ability to diagnose various illnesses and provide necessary information.
